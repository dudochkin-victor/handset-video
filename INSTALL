The Video Player application requires Qt 4.6.2 or later, the MeeGo
Touch Framework, libqttracker, and the Qt Mobility API 1.0.

You can get the MeeGo Touch Framework from http://qt.gitorious.org/maemo-6-ui-framework (you need libdui and duitheme).

You can get the Qt Mobility API from http://qt.nokia.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/new-qt-apis/mobility

You can get libqttracker from http://maemo.gitorious.org/maemo-af/libqttracker

Build the Video Player by running qmake and then compiling it, e.g.

  qmake
  make
  sudo make install

And then run it as:

  meegovideo

It looks for videos in these directories:

  ~/Videos/Films
  ~/Videos/My Movies
  ~/Videos/TV Shows

If you want to generate developer documentation, install the Doxygen
tool and then run "doxygen" in this directory. Documentation in html
and latex format will be generated under the doc directory.
Point your web browser to doc/html/index.html

If you want documentation in PDF format go into the doc/latex
directory and run make. The manual will be generated as refman.pdf.
